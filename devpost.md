## Inspiration What inspired us to build this project is the interest in investment but lack of knowledge and experience to invest.

## What it does It provides a platform for people to invest virtual money in trading and gain a fist hand experience before diving into real time trading.

_How we built it: We built StockVerse using React with the Context API for global state management, allowing real-time portfolio updates and stock trading simulations. Tailwind CSS was used for a modern, responsive UI, and Vite provided a fast development setup with hot reload. Stock prices are simulated to update every 10 seconds, and all portfolio and transaction data is stored in React state with optional persistence via localStorage. The app features a dashboard, buy/sell interface, transaction history, and performance metrics, creating a fully interactive virtual trading experience.‚Äù_
